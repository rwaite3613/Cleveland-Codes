    <summary><strong>THE USA IN THE FIRST WORKD WAR</strong></summary>
	<P>When the First World War began in 1914 the USA remained neutral. However, Germany alienated
American public opinion on 7 May 1915 when a German submarine sank the Cunard liner Lusitania,
without warning. Among the 1,198 people killed were 128 Americans. Nevertheless, Woodrow Wilson
fought the 1916 election partly on the slogan 'he kept us out of the war'.</P>
<p>
   On 6 April 1917 the USA declared war on Germany. America had a strong navy but a relatively small
army. However, conscription was introduced and the USA began to raise a huge army. The first US
troops were sent to France in June 1917 but it was the spring of 1918 before large numbers arrived. By
September the US commander General John J. Pershing was able to begin an offensive against the
Germans. In September 1918 US troops destroyed a German salient at St Mihiel. They then launched an
attack on the Meuse-Argonne area. German troops were pushed back until Germany surrendered on 11
November 1918.</p>
